# Day 5: Server Components and Content Architecture

## Key Learnings

### Server vs Client Components

<Card>
Today's biggest insight was about Next.js server components. By default, all components are server components unless they:
1. Use client-side features (hooks, browser APIs)
2. Are explicitly marked with 'use client'
3. Are imported by another client component

Example: Our `HomeIndex.tsx` doesn't need 'use client' because it only handles static content rendering.
</Card>

<Tip>
Keep components as server components when possible for better performance and smaller JavaScript bundles.
</Tip>

### React Query Usage

<Card>
Initially implemented React Query for project data, but learned it's unnecessary for our static content. 

**Use React Query when you need:**
- Real-time/frequently changing data
- User-specific data after authentication
- Automatic background updates
- Complex API response caching
- Loading/error state management

**Don't use React Query when:**
- Data is static (like our MDX content)
- Content rarely changes
- Data is the same for all users
- No API calls needed
</Card>

```typescript
// Before: Unnecessary use of React Query
const { data: projects } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['projects'],
    queryFn: () => allProjects
});

// After: Direct use of ContentLayer data
const projects = allProjects;
```

<Warning>
Choose data fetching strategies based on your data's nature. Static content (like MDX) doesn't need client-side data fetching libraries.
</Warning>

### Content Organization

<Steps>
1. **Separated Content Types**
   - Projects: Main project information
   - Logs: Daily progress updates
   - Posts: Standalone articles

2. **Content Relationships**
   - Logs are tied to projects via `projectId`
   - Posts can reference multiple projects
   - Projects can have multiple associated logs
</Steps>

### Date Handling

<Warning>
Always specify timezone information in date strings to avoid inconsistencies across different environments.
Example: `2025-03-24T12:00:00-05:00`
</Warning>

## Technical Implementations

```typescript
// Example of a server component
function StaticComponent() {
    return <div>No 'use client' needed</div>
}

// Example of when 'use client' is needed
'use client'
function InteractiveComponent() {
    const [state, setState] = useState()
    return <div>Needs client-side features</div>
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement project-log relationships in the UI
2. Add interactive features where needed
3. Improve content organization
4. Document best practices learned

<Tip>
Remember: Always question whether a component truly needs to be a client component before adding 'use client'.
