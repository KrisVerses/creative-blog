# Day 1: Project Setup and Architecture

Today marked the beginning of the Creative Blog project. The focus was on setting up a solid foundation with modern tools and best practices.

## Completed Tasks

1. Initialized Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
2. Set up ContentLayer for MDX processing
3. Configured Tailwind CSS
4. Created basic project structure
5. Implemented initial routing

## Technical Decisions

### Next.js App Router
Chose the App Router for better server components support and improved performance.

### ContentLayer Integration
```typescript
// contentlayer.config.ts
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: '**/*.mdx',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    date: { type: 'date', required: true }
  }
}))
```

## Challenges and Solutions

<Warning>
  ContentLayer's TypeScript integration required careful configuration to ensure
  proper type inference for MDX content.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Using `satisfies` operator in TypeScript helped ensure type safety while
  maintaining good developer experience.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

1. Implement MDX components
2. Set up the blog post layout
3. Add search functionality
4. Create the home page design

## Learning Outcomes

- Better understanding of Next.js 14 features
- Improved TypeScript configuration skills
- MDX content management patterns
