# Next.js Best Practices and Tools

<Card>
  Modern web development requires a solid understanding of best practices and tools.
  This guide covers key concepts we've implemented in our blog project, from component
  patterns to content management strategies.
</Card>

## Component Architecture

### Container vs Presentational Pattern

<Steps>
1. **Container Components**
   - Handle data fetching
   - Manage state
   - Example: `page.tsx` files

2. **Presentational Components**
   - Focus on UI rendering
   - Accept props for data
   - Example: `HomeIndex.tsx`, `PostCard.tsx`

3. **Benefits**
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Improved testability
   - Easier maintenance
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Keep your page components clean by moving complex logic to container components
  and UI elements to presentational components.
</Tip>

## Client vs Server Components

<Warning>
  Always add 'use client' directive when using hooks or browser APIs. Server
  components can't use state, effects, or browser-specific features.
</Warning>

### When to Use Each

<Card>
  **Server Components (Default)**
  - Static content rendering
  - Data fetching
  - Access to backend resources
  
  **Client Components**
  - Interactive features
  - State management
  - Browser APIs
</Card>

## Content Management Approaches

### Git-based CMS (Current Approach)

<Steps>
1. **Content Structure**
   - MDX files in `/content`
   - Frontmatter for metadata
   - ContentLayer for processing

2. **Benefits**
   - Version control
   - Developer-friendly
   - No database needed
   - Fast builds

3. **Best For**
   - Developer blogs
   - Documentation
   - Small-medium sites
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Git-based CMS might not be suitable for sites requiring frequent content updates
  by non-technical users or real-time features.
</Warning>

## Search Implementation

### Client-side Search

<Card>
  **Current Implementation**
  ```typescript
  const filteredPosts = posts.filter(post =>
    post.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm)
  );
  ```

  **Benefits**
  - Instant results
  - No server load
  - Works offline
</Card>

<Tip>
  For larger datasets, consider implementing server-side search or using a hybrid
  approach combining both client and server search.
</Tip>

## Styling Best Practices

### Tailwind Patterns

<Steps>
1. **Component-based Styles**
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Create reusable patterns
   - Leverage Tailwind's utility classes

2. **Typography**
   - Use prose classes for markdown content
   - Consistent spacing with margin utilities
   - Responsive text sizes

3. **Dark Mode**
   - Use class strategy
   - Consistent color schemes
   - Proper contrast ratios
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Avoid mixing different styling approaches. Stick to Tailwind's utility-first
  approach for consistency.
</Warning>

## Performance Optimization

<Card>
  **Key Areas**
  - Component code splitting
  - Image optimization with Next/Image
  - Proper use of static/dynamic imports
  - Efficient state management
</Card>

<Tip>
  Use React DevTools and Next.js Analytics to identify performance bottlenecks
  and optimize accordingly.
</Tip>

## Navigation and Routing

### Best Practices

<Steps>
1. **URL Structure**
   - Clean, semantic URLs
   - Consistent patterns
   - SEO-friendly

2. **Navigation**
   - Use Next.js Link component
   - Handle loading states
   - Manage search params

3. **Dynamic Routes**
   - Organize by feature
   - Use catch-all routes wisely
   - Implement proper fallbacks
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Avoid using imperative navigation (router.push) when declarative navigation
  (Link component) can be used instead.
</Warning>

## Conclusion

<Card>
  Remember that best practices are guidelines, not rules. Always consider your
  specific use case and requirements when making architectural decisions.
</Card>

<Tip>
  Keep learning and iterating on these patterns as new features and best practices
  emerge in the Next.js ecosystem.
