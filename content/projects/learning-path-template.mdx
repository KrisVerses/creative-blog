# Project Learning Path Structure

<Card>
Every project should follow this documentation structure to make learning and reference easier for both developers and visitors.
</Card>

## Core Documentation Files

<Steps>
1. **SETUP.md**
   - Environment setup
   - Dependencies
   - Configuration steps
   - Initial commands
   - Common issues & solutions

2. **IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Architecture decisions
   - Component structure
   - Data flow
   - Key features
   - Code patterns used

3. **DAILY-LEARNINGS.md**
   - Day-by-day progress
   - Challenges faced
   - Solutions found
   - Best practices discovered
   - Gotchas & tips
</Steps>

## Example Structure

```markdown
project-name/
├── docs/
│   ├── SETUP.md
│   ├── IMPLEMENTATION.md
│   └── daily/
│       ├── day-1-project-setup.md
│       ├── day-2-core-features.md
│       └── day-3-optimizations.md
```

<Warning>
Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves. Outdated docs can be more harmful than no docs.
</Warning>

## Documentation Guidelines

<Steps>
1. **SETUP.md Format**
   ```markdown
   # Project Setup
   ## Prerequisites
   ## Installation Steps
   ## Configuration
   ## Common Issues
   ```

2. **IMPLEMENTATION.md Format**
   ```markdown
   # Implementation Guide
   ## Architecture Overview
   ## Key Components
   ## Data Flow
   ## Design Patterns
   ```

3. **Daily Learning Format**
   ```markdown
   # Day X: [Focus Area]
   ## Key Learnings
   ## Challenges
   ## Solutions
   ## Next Steps
   ```
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use this structure for all projects to build a consistent knowledge base that's easy to reference and share.
</Tip>

## Benefits

<Card>

</Card>

## Example Usage

<Steps>
1. **Project Start**
   - Copy template structure
   - Fill in SETUP.md first
   - Start daily learning logs

2. **During Development**
   - Update IMPLEMENTATION.md
   - Add daily learnings
   - Document challenges

3. **Project Completion**
   - Review and clean up docs
