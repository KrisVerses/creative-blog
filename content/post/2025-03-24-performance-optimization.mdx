Today was all about performance optimization. It's fascinating how small changes can make a big difference in user experience.

## Performance Metrics

### Initial Load Time
- Before: 2.8s
- After: 1.2s
- Improvement: 57% faster

### First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Before: 1.5s
- After: 0.8s
- Improvement: 47% faster

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Image Optimization

```tsx
// Before
<img src="/large-image.jpg" alt="Large image" />

// After
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/large-image.jpg"
  alt="Large image"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  loading="lazy"
  placeholder="blur"
/>
```

### 2. Code Splitting

```tsx
// Before
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent'

// After
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'))
```

### 3. Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Implemented stale-while-revalidate pattern
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  return {
    props: {
      data,
      revalidate: 3600 // Revalidate every hour
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Lazy Loading**: Not everything needs to load immediately
2. **Caching**: Proper caching can dramatically improve performance
3. **Bundle Size**: Smaller bundles mean faster load times

## Tools Used

- Lighthouse for performance metrics
- Chrome DevTools for detailed analysis
- Next.js Analytics for real-world data

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement service worker
- [ ] Add resource hints
- [ ] Optimize third-party scripts
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

Remember: Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
