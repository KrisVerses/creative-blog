Started building The Creative Log — excited to ship a daily growth journal!

## Project Setup

Today I initialized the project with Next.js and ContentLayer. The setup process was smooth, and I'm particularly excited about using MDX for content management.

### Key Decisions

- Using Next.js 14 with App Router
- ContentLayer for MDX processing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

<Info>
  The project structure follows the Next.js 14 best practices, with a clear separation between content and components.

## Next Steps

1. Set up the blog post layout
2. Implement the tag system
3. Add search functionality
4. Style the components

Looking forward to tomorrow's progress!
