Today was a day of deep reflection on the learning process. I've been diving into new technologies and frameworks, and it's fascinating how each piece of knowledge builds upon the previous.

## Key Learnings

1. **Content Management**: Setting up ContentLayer has been a game-changer. The way it handles MDX content and provides type safety is impressive.

2. **Next.js App Router**: The new routing system in Next.js 13+ is powerful, though it took some time to wrap my head around the server components concept.

3. **TypeScript Integration**: The type safety across the stack is giving me confidence in the codebase.

## Challenges Faced

The main challenge today was understanding the relationship between ContentLayer and Next.js. There were moments of confusion, but breaking it down into smaller pieces helped.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add tag filtering
- [ ] Set up analytics
- [ ] Create a proper README

Remember: Every line of code is a step forward in the learning journey.
