# Category Page Implementation

## Overview
The Category page is a dynamic, client-side rendered page that displays posts and projects filtered by category. It features a modern design with category-specific styling, search functionality, and responsive layouts.

## Key Features

### 1. Category-Specific Styling
- Uses a context-based color system (`useColors` hook) for category-specific theming
- Implements a unique marker-style highlight effect for category titles
- Dynamic background and accent colors based on the selected category

### 2. Search and Filtering
- Real-time search functionality with highlighted matching terms
- Filters both posts and projects simultaneously
- Multi-word search support with case-insensitive matching
- Visual feedback for search results with counters

### 3. Content Organization
- Separate sections for Posts and Projects
- Grid-based layout that's responsive across different screen sizes
- Image support with hover animations
- Empty state handling with contextual messages

## Technical Implementation

### Category Context
```typescript
type CategorySlug = 'coding' | 'design' | 'health' | 'life' | 'productivity' | 'self-help' | 'travel' | 'writing';
```
- Strictly typed category system
- Context-based color management for consistent theming
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

### Search Implementation
```typescript
const matchesSearchTerms = (text: string) => {
    if (searchTerms.length === 0) return true;
    const normalizedText = text.toLowerCase();
    return searchTerms.every(term => normalizedText.includes(term));
};
```
- Efficient search using `useMemo` for performance
- Multi-term search with all terms required to match
- Searches both titles and summaries

### Content Cards
- Consistent card design across posts and projects
- Interactive hover states with smooth transitions
- Accessible markup with ARIA labels and roles
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component

### Statistics Display
- Real-time content statistics
- Four key metrics:
  1. Total Posts
  2. Total Projects
  3. Filtered Posts
  4. Filtered Projects
- Responsive grid layout for stats display

## Accessibility Features
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Screen reader support for search and filtering
- Live regions for dynamic content updates
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint-based layouts:
  - Single column on mobile
  - Two columns on tablet
  - Three columns on desktop
- Flexible grid system for content cards
- Adaptive typography and spacing

## Performance Considerations
- Memoized content filtering
- Optimized image loading
- Client-side search to minimize server load
- Efficient DOM updates using React's virtual DOM

## Future Enhancements
1. Advanced filtering options
2. Sort functionality
3. Pagination for large content sets
4. Category-specific meta descriptions
5. Enhanced animation effects

## Usage Example
```typescript
<CategoryPage params={{ slug: 'coding' }} />
```

This implementation provides a robust foundation for displaying categorized content while maintaining performance, accessibility, and user experience best practices.
