Today's focus was on improving code organization and implementing TypeScript best practices. It's amazing how proper structure can make a project more maintainable.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── lib/           # Utility functions and shared logic
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
└── styles/        # Global styles and theme
```

## TypeScript Enhancements

### Type Safety Improvements

```typescript
// Before
const getPost = (slug: string) => {
  return posts.find(post => post.slug === slug)
}

// After
interface Post {
  slug: string
  title: string
  date: string
  tags: string[]
}

const getPost = (slug: string): Post | undefined => {
  return posts.find(post => post.slug === slug)
}
```

## Component Architecture

1. **Atomic Design**: Breaking down components into atoms, molecules, and organisms
2. **Props Interface**: Defining clear interfaces for component props
3. **Error Boundaries**: Implementing proper error handling

## Lessons Learned

- TypeScript's strict mode catches potential issues early
- Component composition is more maintainable than inheritance
- Documentation is as important as the code itself

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

Remember: Clean code is not about perfection, it's about maintainability.
