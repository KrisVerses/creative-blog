# Search Implementation Strategies

## Client-side Search
Perfect for static content and instant results.

### Implementation
```typescript
// Example of client-side search
const posts = allPosts;  // from contentlayer/generated

const filteredPosts = posts.filter(post => 
  post.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm)
);
```

### Benefits
- Instant results
- Works offline
- No server load
- Simple implementation

### Limitations
- Limited to loaded data
- Can't search content deeply
- Performance with large datasets

## Server-side Search
Ideal for dynamic content and deep searching.

### Implementation
```typescript
// Example of server-side search with Sanity
const results = await client.fetch(`
  *[_type == "post" && (
    title match $searchTerm || 
    content match $searchTerm ||
    excerpt match $searchTerm
  )]
`, { searchTerm: "*" + searchTerm + "*" });
```

### Benefits
- Searches entire content
- More accurate results
- Better for large datasets
- Real-time updates

### Limitations
- Requires API calls
- Network dependency
- Server load
- More complex implementation

## Hybrid Approach
Combining the best of both worlds.

### When to Use
- Large content bases
- Need for instant results
- Deep content search
- Real-time updates

### Implementation Strategy
1. Initial load: Get all posts
2. Client-side filtering for:
   - Tag filtering
   - Quick searches
   - Instant UI updates
3. Server-side search for:
   - Deep content search
   - Full-text search
   - Complex queries
